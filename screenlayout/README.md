# Screenlayouts

I use the script(s) in this directory to quickly configure my screen settings
and layout whenever I plug external monitors into my laptop.

As such, these specific configurations will probably be of no use to you.

At the moment, I execute these scripts manually on each screen connection, I
might implement some automization for awesome in the future.
